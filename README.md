# Scripts repository

This repository contains the code used in a project "Quality control for deep learning-based image segmentation for reliable integration into medical workflows" performed by Elena Williams, Sebastian Niehaus, Janis Reinelt, Alberto Merola, Paul Glad Mihai,  Nico Scherf, Ingo Röder and Maria del C. Valdés Hernández.

Each folder is related to a particular set of experiments. The data preparation folder includes all the scripts used to pre-process, analyse the data, and split it into the training, validation, and test sets. The folders with Monte Carlo U-net, Reconstruction and Regression experiments include scripts with model architectures, training and evaluation procedures as well as other supplementary code.

The scripts are presented solely for demonstration purposes and are not intended to be reproducible.
